Detailed project report

## Outline
<p align='justify'>
*Climate Science* has become an intimidating subject matter which is drawing attention in recent days.
It is evident that human activities are driving the global warming since mid-20th century. The industrial activities that our modern civilization has taken up leads to raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
</p>
<p align='justify'>
UN Climate change states that the past seven years were the warmest on record. Countries that host billions of people and are responsible for up to 70% of human-caused emissions are predicted to get affected the most. This leads to increasing socio-economic impacts. Consequently, making populations vulnerable to extreme weather in different parts of the world. 
</p>
<p align='justify'>
Climate impacts heading into uncharted territory of destruction by increasingly devastating and leading to many natural calamities. This report will unveil the most inquisitive questions arising which causes and mechanism in global warming along with the human activities leading to natural changes in the environment.  As a consequence how humankind is affected, especially children. This study will address the following questions,
</p>
<p align='justify'>
1. What is the mechanism behind the occurrence of climatic change?
	- Emissions of greenhouse gases over a period of time due to industrial revolution.
	- Descriptive statistics on factor facilitating Climate change.
2. Study the trend in natural disaster due to global warming.
3. Analysis on children vulnerability to climatic change with respective to Children Climate risk index(CCRI) data.
</p>

**Data Source**
<br>
The Key metrics which contributes to the global climate change is maintained by Our World in Data. 
Data source will be accessed by from Github API with *R* language. There are 3 datasets which will be used for this study, namely
<br>
1. Emission levels data<br>
	  Link : *<https://github.com/owid/co2-data>* <br>
2. Natural disaster data<br>
	  Link : *<https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets/Natural%20disasters%20(EMDAT%20–%20decadal)>* <br>
3. Global temperature anomaly data<br>
	  Link : *<https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets/Global%20temperature%20anomaly%20-%20Met%20Office%20(HadCRUT4)>* <br>

Code to extract data:
```{r}
#Code to extract data:
#co2_data <- read_csv('https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/owid-public/data/co2/owid-co2-data.csv')
#head(co2_data)
```

## Main visualization of the data 

### Global greenhouse gas emissions as per each sectors

[![Global greenhouse gas emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2020/09/Emissions-by-sector-–-pie-charts.png)](https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector)

<p align='justify'>
Globally, we emit around 50 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases each year. To prevent severe climate change we need to rapidly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Analyzing the this, we could effectively reduce emissions to prevent climate change.
</p>

### Seasonality in global temperature anomaly

<p align='justify'>
This visualization illustrates the warming in a series of circles, each one portraying a year in the historical climate record spanning 1850 to 2016. As time passes and the planet warms, the circles expand outward
</p>

## Additional visualizations and further analyses with the data
1. Trend analysis of each country emission level
2. Children Climate Risk Index

## Conclusion
<p align='justify'>
The world is entering unprecedented era as climate change drives unprecedented global environmental, societal, and economic disruption. Exploring and analyzing the greenhouse gas emitters due to industrial revolution, while taking proper measures we can protect and support the society, especially the children.
