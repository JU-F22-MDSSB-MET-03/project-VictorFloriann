Detailed project report

*The following headlines are suggestions only.*

## Outline



*What questions will the report address and why?*

1. What is the mechanism behind the occurrence of climatic change?
	- Emissions of greenhouse gases over a period of time around the world
	- Trend in atmospheric concentrations of CO2
	- Energy consuming of countries in terms of economy at current GDP
	- Who are the largest emitters over the period
	- Sea level and glaciers role in climate change
2. How are children vulnerable to change in climate with respective to Children Climate risk index data globally.

*How can data be accessed. Code for loading.*
The Key metrics which contributes to the global climate change is maintained by Our World in Data. 
*Link: <https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions>*


*Information how data is collected. Who collects data.*
The data produced by third parties and made available by Our World in Data.
Last update of the data was on September 6, 2022
The data is updated regularly. Most metrics are published on an annual basis and contains all the information on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

*Be very brief here, if necessary provide and refer to an appendix. You can also use footnotes.^[This is a footnote, which can be used for more information which maybe a reader.]*

Your report shall follow an "inverted pyramid" story format [see @Dykes2019EffectiveDataStorytelling] as shown in @fig-dykesstoryformats .

Remove all this text and put you content.^[Using this template is not mandatory.]

If the final report has sufficient quality, it can be published to the web directly from here, if you want. 
Also a check for copyright or data privacy violations is necessary.

## Main visualization of the data 

*Better give a more substantial title.*

This should present you main point visually with one (or more) figures.

```{r}
#| label: fig-mainvisualization
#| fig-cap: "The figure shows this ... (but is just a placeholder)."
mpg |> ggplot(aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point()
```

@fig-mainvisualization shows the insight.

*Refer here to*

- *Additional visualizations and analysis below*
- *Interactive Visualization / Dashboard below*

## Additional visualizations and further analyses with the data

*Better give a more substantial title.*

### You may have subsections here or elsewhere

### However, subsections usually make sense when there is more than one

## Conclusion

*Topics like: What have we learned? How does it fit in or help in broader contexts? What remains open?*

## Interactive Visualization / Data Dashboard {.appendix}

*Either have this here or on another webpage (new quarto file).*

*Interactive visualizations may also appear above.* 

*The focus here is to provide the reader with sensible ways to explore the data independently. You have to think about what could be of interest.*




## Data Source {.appendix}

*If specific information and details about the data source would be too long in the "Outline" section, put it in an appendix section.* 

## Other appendix sections {.appendix}

*Do the same with other text which distracts the reading of the main text. *

## References {.unnumbered .appendix}
