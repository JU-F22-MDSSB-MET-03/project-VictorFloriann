## Climate change

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- Climate change is a change which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity 
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- Climate change alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparative period of time.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
- Humankind is affected, especially children
:::

## Effects of Climate Change - Overall Rise in Temperature

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](img/Global_surface_temperature_rise.png)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Air temperatures on Earth have been rising 1.1° Celsius (1.9° Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution <br>
- 2010–2019 decade being the warmest on record

:::
:::


## Sea ice level changes in North and South pole

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Changes in Northern Sea ice level is consistently decreasing over the years
- Southern sea ice level is consistently increasing
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## The green house effect
- Industrial revolution lead to carbon dioxide emissions which increased rapidly starting from 1950
![Carbon Dioxide Increase](img/CO2_Increase.png)

## Green House gases effect

- CO2, NO2, CH4 and Aerosols are harmfull gases emitted into atmosphere
- Increase in gas level per year increases climate change disaster

## Natural disaster due to climate changes in 2010


## Continents affected by climate change disasters in 2010
- People of Asia have been most affected by climate change related natural disasters

## Climate Risks

![Climate_Risks.](https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/climate-risks-1.5-degree-vs-2-degree-global-warming-climate-change-facts-infographic.jpg)
## CCRI (Children Climate Risk Index)

- CCRI generates new global evidence on the number of children who are currently exposed to climate and environmental hazards, shocks, and stresses through data analysis.
- A composite index, the CCRI brings together geographical data by analyzing 
1.) exposure to climate and environmental hazards, shocks and stresses; 
2.) child vulnerability.

## Climate Environmental Shocks and Child_vulnerability

## Children Climate Risk Index (CCRI)

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Approximately 1 billion children (nearly half of the world’s children) live in countries with extremely high risk

# Climate and our future

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- World is entering an unprecedented era as climate change drives unprecedented global environmental, societal, and economic disruption
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Policymakers must improve their listening skills and incorporate young people’s perspectives and experiences into climate policies and processes
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Providing young people with climate education and green skills
